HULK is a tool that creates small, fixed-size sketches from streaming microbiome sequencing data,
enabling rapid metagenomic dissimilarity analysis. HULK generates a k-mer spectrum from a FASTQ data stream,
incrementally sketches it and makes similarity search queries against other microbiome sketches.

It works by using count-min sketching to create a k-mer spectrum from a data stream.
After some reads have been added to a k-mer spectrum, HULK begins to process the counter frequencies and
populates a histosketch. Similarly to MinHash sketches, histosketches can be used to estimate similarity
between microbiome samples.`,
