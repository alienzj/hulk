# Analysis Notebooks

>IMPORTANT: the notebooks (1-3) use HULK v0.0.2 and replicate the analysis found in the pre-print.

>subsequent releases of HULK use a different hashing function (and also have some
other changes), so results generated in these notebooks will not match if you
use a version != v0.0.2.

>Check out the documentation and tutorial for some more up to date examples.

***

This directory contains all the code to generate the analysis and figures as found in the paper.

From this directory, start a notebook (`jupyter notebook`) and run the code for yourself.

All the HULK sketches and comparison matrices are included in `./data`, but you can also generated these yourself using the commands at the top of each notebook.
