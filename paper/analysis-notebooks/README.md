# Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains all the code to generate the analysis and figures as found in the paper.

From this directory, start a notebook (`jupyter notebook`) and run the code for yourself.

All the HULK sketches and comparison matrices are included in `./data`, but you can also generated these yourself using the commands at the top of each notebook.
